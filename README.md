# Dam-breaking-case
Simulation of classical 2D dam-breaking case on OpenFoam and validation with data in literature [1]. The simulation is carried out in OpenFoam using VOF approach employing the interFoam solver. Pressure is compared at coordinates (3.22, 0.16) in the domain and the interface heights at abscissa 2.228 and 2.725. The same mesh size, domain and boundary conditions as [1] were applied in OpenFoam.  The pressure and inerface height comparison files are uploaded.
